## Chapter 2â€”Search fundamentals <br />

#### What are planning and searching?
- Planning: Details to acomplish task.
- Searching: Guide by steps in plan.

#### Cost of Computation
Cost = Processing Time.
Big O Notation = Complexity (Models number of operations as inputs increases).

#### Problems applicable to searching algorithms
Problem that requires a series of decisions to be made can be solved with search algorithms <br />
Optimal Solution: The performance of the solution in addressing the problem at hand. <br />
The problem space needs to be represented in a form that is applicable to computation and can be processed with search algorithms. <br />
