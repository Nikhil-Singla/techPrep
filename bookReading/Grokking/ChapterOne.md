## Chapter 1—Intuition of artificial intelligence

#### What is artificial intelligence?
Autonomous; Adaptive creatures are considered to be intelligent. 
Autonomous -> Something doesn't need constant instructions. 
Adaptive -> Can change its behavior as the environment or problem space changes.
Understanding data is important for understanding AI algorithms.

#### Defining AI.
We base our understanding of intelligence on humans as being the dominant (and most intelligent) species.
AI -> A synthetic system that exhibits “intelligent” behavior.
Metric = AI-likeness. Ex. Solutions that can learn autonomously; adapt to new data and environments.
AI is an ambiguous term. What matters is that can solving hard problems.

#### Understanding that data is core to AI algorithms.
Data -> Input to algoritms; raw facts about things. Incorrect, misrepresented, or missing data leads to poor performance in algorithms.
Data exists in forms we can’t even sense. Unlike numerical values, known as quantitative data, data can represent values of observations.
Smell, level of agreement etc is a type of data is known as qualitative data; sometimes difficult to interpret. It’s a perception of someone’s truth.
- In the real world, data has bias and context, and if used to answer question, its called information. Utilizing information leads to knowledge (simulate with AI).
Data intepretation has consequences for quality of solution. ie, scientific aspect of creating technology is hugely important.

#### Viewing algorithms as instructions in recipes
Algorithm -> Set of instructions and rules provided as a specification to accomplish a specific goal.
- typically accept inputs
- have several finite steps 
- progresses through varying states
- produces an output
An algorithm can be viewed as a recipe; Given some ingredients and tools as inputs, and instructions for creating a specific dish, a meal is the output.
Uses: Enable live and remote video chat (compression algorithms), navigate cities (real-time routing algorithms), translate human code into machine code (coding algorithms)
Algorithm has discrete steps that perform an action or determine a decision before moving to the next operation.
