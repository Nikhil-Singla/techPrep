## Chapter 1—Intuition of artificial intelligence <br />

#### What is artificial intelligence? <br />
Autonomous; Adaptive creatures are considered to be intelligent. <br />
Autonomous -> Something doesn't need constant instructions. <br />
Adaptive -> Can change its behavior as the environment or problem space changes. <br />
Understanding data is important for understanding AI algorithms. <br />

#### Defining AI. <br />
We base our understanding of intelligence on humans as being the dominant (and most intelligent) species. <br />
AI -> A synthetic system that exhibits “intelligent” behavior. <br />
Metric = AI-likeness. Ex. Solutions that can learn autonomously; adapt to new data and environments. <br />
AI is an ambiguous term. What matters is that can solving hard problems. <br />

#### Understanding that data is core to AI algorithms. <br />
Data -> Input to algoritms; raw facts about things. Incorrect, misrepresented, or missing data leads to poor performance in algorithms. <br />
Data exists in forms we can’t even sense. Unlike numerical values, known as quantitative data, data can represent values of observations. <br />
Smell, level of agreement etc is a type of data is known as qualitative data; sometimes difficult to interpret. It’s a perception of someone’s truth. <br />
- In the real world, data has bias and context, and if used to answer question, its called information. Utilizing information leads to knowledge (simulate with AI). <br />
Data intepretation has consequences for quality of solution. ie, scientific aspect of creating technology is hugely important. <br />

#### Viewing algorithms as instructions in recipes <br />
Algorithm -> Set of instructions and rules provided as a specification to accomplish a specific goal. <br />
- typically accept inputs <br />
- have several finite steps <br />
- progresses through varying states <br />
- produces an output <br />
An algorithm can be viewed as a recipe; Given some ingredients and tools as inputs, and instructions for creating a specific dish, a meal is the output. <br />
Uses: Enable live and remote video chat (compression algorithms), navigate cities (real-time routing algorithms), translate human code into machine code (coding algorithms) <br />
Algorithm has discrete steps that perform an action or determine a decision before moving to the next operation. <br />
