Purpose of developing technologies: Change the way we live, and shape the way we interact with the world and the way we think about it.
Reasons for AI Boom -
- Exponential Growth [Mainly dependent on problem solving fundamentals]
- Internet dev. + Mass data collection
- Algorithm improvements for massive data
- Industries actually leveraging data (for profit)
- Tech improvements (microchips, PC's and digitization)

Keep in Mind: Legal and Ethical Development
Data collected from humans has biases. Minimize prejudice and get balanced data. Get consent; people prefer it during data collection if its useful and consensual
Singularity: AI self improves = Super intelligence 

• Chapter 1—Intuition of artificial intelligence, Intro: 
Intuition + Fundamentals of - Data, types of problems, categories of algorithms and paradigms, and use cases for artificial intelligence algorithms.

• Chapter 2—Search fundamentals, Core concepts of data structures: 
Approaches for primitive search algorithms, and their uses.

• Chapter 3—Intelligent search, Beyond primitive search algorithms:
More optimal algorithms, and solutions in a competitive environment.

• Chapter 4—Evolutionary algorithms, dives into the workings of genetic
algorithms where solutions to problems are iteratively generated and improved
upon by mimicking evolution in nature.

• Chapter 5—Advanced evolutionary approaches, is a continuation of genetic
algorithms but tackles advanced concepts involving how steps in the algorithm
can be adjusted to solve different types of problems more optimally.

• Chapter 6—Swarm intelligence: Ants, digs into the intuition for swam intelligence
and works through how the ant colony optimization algorithm uses a theory of
how ants live and work to solve hard problems.

• Chapter 7—Swarm intelligence: Particles, continues with swarm algorithms while
diving into what optimization problems are, and how they’re solved using
particle swarm optimization—as it seeks good solutions in large search spaces.

• Chapter 8—Machine learning, works through a machine learning workflow for
data preparation, processing, modeling, and testing—to solve regression
problems with linear regression, and classification problems with decision trees.

• Chapter 9—Artificial neural networks, uncovers the intuition, logical steps, and
mathematical calculations in training and using an artificial neural network to
find patterns in data and make predictions; while highlighting its place in a
machine learning workflow.

• Chapter 10—Reinforcement learning with Q-Learning, covers the intuition of
reinforcement learning from behavioral psychology, and works through the
Q-Learning algorithm for agents to learn good and bad decisions to make in an
environment.
