Purpose of developing technologies: Change the way we live, and shape the way we interact with the world and the way we think about it.
Reasons for AI Boom -
- Exponential Growth [Mainly dependent on problem solving fundamentals]
- Internet dev. + Mass data collection
- Algorithm improvements for massive data
- Industries actually leveraging data (for profit)
- Tech improvements (microchips, PC's and digitization)

Keep in Mind: Legal and Ethical Development
Data collected from humans has biases. Minimize prejudice and get balanced data. Get consent; people prefer it during data collection if its useful and consensual
Singularity: AI self improves = Super intelligence
